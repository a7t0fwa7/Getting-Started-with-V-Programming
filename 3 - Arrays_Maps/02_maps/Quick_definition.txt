A map is used to represent a collection of key-value pairs. The keys need to be of a primitive data type. 
A map is defined using the map keyword. By default, maps are immutable. 
We can define a mutable map using the mut keyword.

Maps are like dictionary types in other programming languages such as Dictionary in C#, HashMap in Java, and dict in Python. 
We will explore how to work with maps, including various ways in which to initialize maps. 
Then, we will look at how to add, update, or delete key-value pairs from the map.
